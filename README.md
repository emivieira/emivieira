# 👋 Olá! I’m Emilaine

Welcome to my corner of the data multiverse — where numbers meet storytelling, queries are tested, logic does its best, and every null value has its reason. Probably.

I'm a data and content specialist helping media and digital companies understand their audience, improve their products, and ask better questions. 

With a background in journalism, systems development, and an MBA in Data Science & Analytics, I collaborate with engineers, editors, product managers — and occasionally, reality itself (though results may vary).


#### ✨ Besides data, curiosity, and stubbornness, I also rely on:

- 📊 Deep experience in digital analytics and audience behavior
- 🤝 The ability to bridge business, product, engineering, and newsroom teams — all while preventing another civil war
- ⚙️ Rolling up my sleeves for data work — from early mapping to figuring out what no one bothered to document
- 🔍 Analyzing large datasets (sometimes on purpose, sometimes because curiosity got out of hand)
- 🧩 Turning vague business questions into structured data projects — ideally before anyone changes the requirements again
- 🔮 Presenting data insights that feel like they came from a crystal ball, but took a lot of data
